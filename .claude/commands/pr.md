# PR Workflow & Validation Command

Execute the complete PR workflow with comprehensive validation following our production-ready standards.

## Comprehensive PR Workflow Steps

1. **Build comprehensive tests** for all new functionality
2. **Run full test suite** and ensure 100% pass rate
3. **Run linter** and fix all issues
4. **Validate development server** (npm run dev)
5. **Validate production build** (npm run build)
6. **Security review** - comprehensive security validation
7. **Final validation** - re-run tests and linter
8. **Analyze changes** - review git diff and commit history since main
9. **Generate PR title** - create descriptive title following our format standards
10. **Generate PR description** - comprehensive description using our template
11. **Create PR** - use gh pr create with generated title and description
12. **Apply labels** - add appropriate type, priority, size, and area labels

## Validation Requirements

### Test Development
- Create tests for all new functionality
- Focus on critical paths and edge cases
- Include happy path, edge cases, and integration tests
- Ensure 100% pass rate before proceeding

### Code Quality Gates
- Zero linting errors or warnings
- All TypeScript strict mode compliance
- No console.log statements in production code
- No commented-out code blocks

### Functionality Gates
- All new features work as designed
- Existing functionality remains unaffected
- Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly
- Loading states implemented where appropriate

### Performance Gates
- Build time impact is minimal
- Bundle size increase is justified
- Database queries are optimized
- API response times are acceptable

### Security Gates (Comprehensive Review)
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Verify auth checks at all endpoints, role-based access control
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas implemented, server-side validation, proper sanitization
- **Data Protection**: RLS policies on database tables, sensitive data handling
- **Injection Prevention**: SQL injection prevention, XSS protection measures
- **API Security**: Proper CORS, rate limiting, error handling without information leakage
- **Environment Security**: No hard-coded secrets, proper environment variable usage
- No sensitive data exposed in logs or errors

## Success Criteria

A branch is ready for PR when:
- All validation steps complete successfully
- Manual testing confirms expected behavior
- Code review checklist items are addressed
- Documentation reflects any necessary updates
